### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

This challenge starts off with an if statement for the systolic reading then had another if statement underneath it for the diastolic reading.  The point of this was to shorten the number of if statements so after each of my if-else statements I did not follow them up with another if statement.  I used logical operators and the correct usage of parentheses to combine both the systolic and diastolic reading in the same statement.  With all operations for the chart covered all that was left was to have the system read "ERROR" when the systolic was less than the diastolic. To impliment this I just ended the if statement with an else statement that said if none of the other cases above appear then print "ERROR".  By going this route it appears that I've saved a total if 4 if statements.  at this point I cannot think of a way to shorten the if statements to an even lower number.
